- 👋 Hi, I’m Wojciech! :)
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming and game development just as much as QA and frontend.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript (for test purposes) and C#/Unity (for gamedev).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything JS/TS-related whilst also beginner-friendly.
- 📫 How to reach me? The easiest way would be through my LinkedIn. :)
